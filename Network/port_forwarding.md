## What is port_forwarding ?

### 1. TCP/IP Ports

- TCP/IP Port identifies application or service on a machine in a TCP/IP network.

- On a TCP/IP network every device must have an IP address

- The ip address identifies the device

- However a device can run multiple applications/services. We need to use port to identifies the application/service running on the machine. The use of ports allow computers to run multiple service or application

- Standard port numbers are allocated to server service (0-1023)

### 2. Port forwarding

- Port forwarding, some times called port mapping, allows computer or service in private network to connect over the internet with other public or private computers or services.

- Simply, port_forwarding allow access to an application form outside your network

- Directs request to your public ip (from outside your network) to a private ip (inside your network)

- Sends incoming traffic from outside the network to a local computer based on the requested port

### 3. Why port-forwarding important ?

- Port forwarding is critical for remote access to items on private network. Since firewalls exist to keep unwanted visitors out, the visitors you want to get in are going to need a way to do so. Knowing the IP address isnâ€™t enough: Requests need to be directed to the correct port as well. This extra required information helps keeps unwanted visitors out and adds a further layer of security against DDoS (direct denial of service) attacks
